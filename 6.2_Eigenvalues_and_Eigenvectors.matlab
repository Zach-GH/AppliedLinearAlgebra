%Enter the matrix C.
C = [6 3 -8; 0 -2 0; 1 0 -3]
%Find the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial.  Store them in PolyCoeffs.
PolyCoeffs = poly(C)
%Use the command roots() to find the eigenvalues.  Store them in evals.
evals = roots(PolyCoeffs)
%Use the eig() command.  Store the eigenvalues in matrix eigDiag.  Store the associated
%eigenvectors in eigV.
[eigV, eigDiag] = eig(C)
