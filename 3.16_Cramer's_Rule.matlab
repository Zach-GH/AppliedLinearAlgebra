%Create the coefficient matrix A and column matrix of constants b.
A = [1 1 -1; 3 -2 1; 1 3 -2]
b = [6; -5; 14]
%Initialize the matrices A1, A2, and A3 as matrix A.
A1 = A
A2 = A
A3 = A
%Replace the appropriate columns in A1, A2, and A3 with the column vector of constants b. 
A1(:,1)=b
A2(:,2)=b
A3(:,3)=b
%Find the solution for x1, x2, and x3 using ratios of determinants.
x1 = det(A1)/det(A)
x2 = det(A2)/det(A)
x3 = det(A3)/det(A)
