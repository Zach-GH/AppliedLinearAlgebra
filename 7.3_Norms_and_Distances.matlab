%To find the Euclidean distance between two vectors, find the 2-norm of the difference of 
%those vectors.  Enter column vectors u and v.  Then use the norm() command to find d(u,v), storing 
%it in dist_uv.
u = [4; 3]
v = [-4; -12]
dist_uv = norm(u-v, 2)
%To find the distance between two matrices with respect to the Frobenius inner product, 
%find the Frobenius norm of the difference of those matrices.  Enter matrices A and B.  
%Then use the norm() command to find d(A,B), storing it in dist_AB.
A = [3 -7 4 3; -2 4 -5 0]
B = [1 -7 2 5; 0 0 -5 2]
dist_AB = norm(A-B, 'fro')
