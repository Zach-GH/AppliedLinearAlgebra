%Create the coefficient matrix A and and the column matrix b of constants.
A = [1 2 3; 3 0 -1; 2 -1 1]
b = [9; 3; 8]
%Use the lu() command to find the LU decomposition of A, storing the lower and upper matrices
%in L and U, respectively.
[ L, U] = lu(A)
%Solve the system of linear equations Ax=b using the LU decomposition.  Store the intermediary
%solution in y.  Store the solution for x in x1.
y = L\b
x1 = U\y
%Check that the solution x1 matches that found by directly using the backslash operator to solve
%the system Ax=b.  Use the backslash operator to solve Ax=b in one step, storing the solution in x2.
x2 = U\(L\b)
