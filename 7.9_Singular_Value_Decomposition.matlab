%Enter the matrix B.
B = [-6 8 6 9; 3 2 4 -8; 5 -4 -7 -3]
%Use the command svd() to find three matrices, namely the mxm orthogonal matrix U, the mxn 
%diagonal matrix S, and the nxn orthogonal matrix V, of the singular value decomposition of B.
[U, S, V] = svd(B)
%Verify that the appropriate product of the matrices found using the svd() command
%results in the matrix B.  Store this product in checkB. 
checkB = U*S*V.'
