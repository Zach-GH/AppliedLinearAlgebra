v2 = [-3 5 -2 2]
v3 = [-1 1 2 0]
v4 = [0 -1 4 -1]
%Create a matrix A with the given vectors placed in the columns of A.
A = [v1.' v2.' v3.' v4.']
%Create the appropriately sized itendity matrix, storing it in I.
I = eye(4)
%Augment A with the identity matrix, storing it in augA.
augA = [A I]
%Row reduce augA, storing it in reduced_aguA.  
reduced_augA = rref(augA)
%Use the pivot colulmns in reduced_augA to identify which of the original vectors are 
%included in the basis, along with which columns of the identity matrix are included in 
%the basis. Create a matrix containing the basis vectors, storing it in BasisMatrix.
