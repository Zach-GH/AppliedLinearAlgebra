%Enter vectors v1, v2, v3, and v4 as row vectors.
v1 = [1 0 1 1]
v2 = [2 -2 3 2]
v3 = [1 -1 1 0]
v4 = [0 -1 1 1]
%Create a matrix A consisting of these vectors as column vectors.
A = [v1.' v2.' v3.' v4.']
%For vectors in 4-space, the reduced matrix will have four pivot columns if the vectors span 4-space.
%Find the reduced matrix, storing it in reducedA.  Do the vectors span 4-space?
reducedA = rref(A)
%The vectors do not span 4-space. There are 3 pivot columns.

%Create the vector w=[2 1 1 1].
w=[2 1 1 1]
%Create an augmented matrix [A|w], storing it in Aw.
Aw = [A w.' ]
%Find the reduced matrix, storing it in reducedAw.  Is w is in the span of the vectors?
reducedAw = rref(Aw)
%There is no solution because of the row of all 0's
