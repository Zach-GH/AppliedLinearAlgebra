%Create the row vectors a=[1, -2, 0, 7] and b=[-3, -1, 5, 0].
a = [1 -2 0 7]
b = [-3 -1 5 0]
%Create the column vectors c=[3, 1, 4, -2] and d=[0, -2, 2, 1].
c = [3; 1; 4; -2]
d = [0; -2; 2; 1]
%Use the dot() command to find the dot product of vectors a and b.  Store this value in g1. 
g1 = dot(a, b)
%Use matrix multiplication to find the dot product of vectors a and b.  Store this value in g2.
g2 = dot(a, b)
%Use the dot() command to find the dot product of vectors c and d.  Store this value in h1. 
h1 = dot(c, d)
%Use matrix multiplication to find the dot product of vectors c and d.  Store this value in h2.
h2 = dot(c, d)
